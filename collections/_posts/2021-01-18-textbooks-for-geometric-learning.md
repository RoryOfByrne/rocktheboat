title: "Geometric reasoning and learning through textbooks"
---

Most knowledge is tribal. Ideas have no form until we impose one for the purposes of communicating the idea to others,
and even then the form is in flux in the receiver's mind. As concepts spread, they change, and this makes learning
difficult.

Why? My theory is this: humans have evolved to have certain abilities for reasoning about the world, and those same abilities
are re-used in abstract thinking. What I'm specifically talking about here is geometric reasoning, which allows us to, for
example, predict that a predator cannot see us when hiding behind a rock. There's no reason to think that the brain
cannot use this ability in the abstract sense too, if concepts are framed geometrically. This is what's happening when we
say things like "concept A is tangential to concept B". When we share an idea with another person, we impose a form on
it, so that the receiver can use their tools of abstract reasoning to comprehend it. It should be no surprise,
therefore, that the type of reasoning we rely on most is the one that evolved in-step with our highly advanced visual cortex.

So how is this related to learning, and where to textbooks come into it? In learning, we use geometric reasoning to make
predictions about the structure and content of future information, and then we compare that with the future information that 
we receive. For this to be effective, information must have useful structure, and be easy to manipulate geometrically
with our reasoning abilities. That information must also be comprehensive, so that we have enough content to play with. 
Lastly, it must be fast - fast to find potentially useful informational structures, fast to ingest those structures, and
fast to compare them to others.

For these purposes, textbooks are great. Podcasts, video lectures, and other temporal media (???) have advantages in
other contexts, but for learning concepts by geometric reasoning alone, you cannot beat a stack of textbooks.
