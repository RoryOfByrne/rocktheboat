title: "Geometric reasoning and learning through textbooks"
---

Most knowledge is tribal. Ideas have no form until we inevitably impose one, either to help us reason about the idea or
else to communicate it to someone else. The structure of ideas is always in flux, and this has implications for our
ability to learn.

Why? My theory is this: humans have evolved certain mental tools for reasoning about the world, and those tools
are also used in abstract thinking. What I'm specifically talking about here is geometric reasoning, which allows us to, for
example, predict that a predator cannot see us when we hide behind a rock. There's no reason to think that the brain
cannot use this ability in the abstract sense too, if concepts are framed geometrically. That's what I think is happening when we
say things like "concept A is tangential to concept B". It should be no surprise that the type of reasoning 
we rely on most is the one that evolved in-step with our highly advanced visual cortex.

So how is this related to learning, and where do textbooks come into it? In (supervised) learning, we use geometric reasoning to make
predictions about the structure and content of future information, and then we compare that with the information 
we receive. This process is most effective when ideas are presented with a useful structure, have enough content to play
with, and don't have a temporal dimension which hinders our ability to map content onto mental models.

With those requirements in-mind, textbooks are great. Temporal media like podcasts and videos have advantages, of course, but for 
learning concepts by geometric reasoning, you cannot beat a stack of textbooks.
